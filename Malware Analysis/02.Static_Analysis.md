## Linux
- check file type - `file [path_to_file]`
- check headers to find file type - `hexdump -C [path_to_file] | more`
- hash of a file - `md5sum [path_to_file]`
- hash of a file - `sha256sum [path_to_file]`
- Import Hashing (IMPHASH) - hash calculated from the import functions of a Windows Portable Executable (PE) file can be checked on Virustotal or https://pypi.org/project/pefile/
```
import sys
import pefile
import peutils

pe_file = sys.argv[1]
pe = pefile.PE(pe_file)
imphash = pe.get_imphash()

print(imphash)
```
- Fuzzy Hashing (SSDEEP) - `ssdeep [path_to_file]` or virustotal - highly effective in identifying files that have undergone minor modifications
- initiate matching mode in SSDEEP (while we are on the directory where the malware samples are stored) - `ssdeep -pb *`
- Section Hashing (Hashing PE Sections) - identify sections of a Portable Executable (PE) file that have been modified
```
import sys
import pefile
pe_file = sys.argv[1]
pe = pefile.PE(pe_file)
for section in pe.sections:
    print (section.Name, "MD5 hash:", section.get_hash_md5())
    print (section.Name, "SHA256 hash:", section.get_hash_sha256())
```
### String Analysis
- `strings -n  [path_to_file]`
- `floss [path_to_file]`
- Unpacking UPX-packed Malware - `upx -d -o [output_filename] [input_filename]`
